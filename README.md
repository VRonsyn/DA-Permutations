# Combinatorials

This is a Python project named "Permutations". This project is made in the context of the course "
Discrete Algoritmen" at Ghent University. The project is a Python package that provides functions to
generate permutations of a sequence of integers, calculate the rank of a permutation, and generate
the next permutation in both lexicographic and Trotter-Johnson order.

## Features

- Generate permutations of a sequence of integers from a given rank (`unrank()`).
- Calculate the rank of a permutation (`rank()`).
- Generate the next permutation in Trotter-Johnson order (`successor()`).

## Dependencies

This project uses the following dependencies:

- Python 3.10
- Numpy 1.26.4
- Pytest 8.2.0

## Installation

To install the project, you need to have Python 3.10 installed on your system. Then, you can clone
the repository and install the dependencies using Poetry.

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd combinatorials
poetry install
```

## Testing

The project includes a suite of unit tests. You can run these tests using Pytest.

```bash
pytest
```
